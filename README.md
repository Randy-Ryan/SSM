To get started, please properly cconfigure your .env file. This file is not committed within the project repo and must be created to run the backend server. To run the backend server, you must use the command 'node index.js' while in the directory /SSM/functions. This command runs the server locally on http://0.0.0.0:8080. 

The project may also require installing packages with npm. Some of the packages may include express, dotenv, stripe, firebase-functions, and more. Console log error outputs will let you know what is missing!
           
           
            Skate Shoe Mate is a platform designed towards anybody and everybody interested in skating. We allow
            for users to post their skate shoes for sale to the public. Skate shoes are an interesting topic because many skaters
            usually have beat up shoes, where only one of the two shoes of the pair are actually in poor condition. In the case where the
            one shoe is still 'good', someone can post that listing here in hopes for another skater looking to purchase used shoes or instigate an exchange. 
            The exchange works as follows: If two users come to an agreement through messaging - they can essentially upload their posts for an exchange.

            All payment information is processed through Stripe so we, Skate Shoe Mate, are not responsible for anything payment wise. All inquiries about payments
            should be directed towards Stripe.
